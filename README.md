### Brain Visualizer

__Brain Visualizer__ is based on the [Brainfuck-Visualizer](http://fatiherikli.github.io/brainfuck-visualizer). Brain Visualizer is only a __JS interpreter__ for the [Brain Language](https://github.com/brain-labs/brain), thus it is not as fast as the __Brain Compiler__. 

### What is Brain?

Brain is a turing-complete minimal programming language based on [Brainfuck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck) with about 20 commands.

### What is the Brain Compiler?

The __Brain__ compiler wants to improve the performance of the Brainfuck programming language and extend it as well, as Brainfuck itself has a lack of flexibility and does not perform great control over complex computations. __Brain__ is open to new model represetantion and allows programmers to extend its capability by attaching `LLVM IR` to its code.

One of the main ideas of __Brain__ is saving some operations in machine language, creating an instruction optimizer due to the excess of instructions that Brainfuck would generate. Brain aims to implement it by using current technology __(LLVM)__.

In spite of implementing new commands and features, __Brain__ is **completely compatible** with Brainfuck (but the opposite is not true).
